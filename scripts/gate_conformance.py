"""Assert the pr / open-pr / merge-pr triad still carries its required guards.

TEMPLATE v3 — vendored verbatim in rusticprofile, retch and etr. Change it here, bump
TEMPLATE_VERSION, and propagate in each repo's own PR. Run by `just standard-check`.

WHAT THIS IS, AND HONESTLY WHAT IT IS NOT
-----------------------------------------
This is a **structural** check. It reads the justfile and asserts each guard is present.
It does NOT prove the guards work — a recipe could satisfy every assertion here and still
be wrong.

That limitation is deliberate rather than lazy, and the reason is worth stating: the install
helpers could be checked behaviourally because their logic is pure functions over a path and
an environment, so `--self-test` can call them. The gate recipes are not: `pr` runs the whole
test suite, regenerates the man page and touches git; `open-pr` pushes and opens a PR;
`merge-pr` merges. Executing them from a `check` dependency would be slow, side-effecting and
occasionally destructive. So this checks that the guards are *there*, and the guards
themselves are exercised for real on every PR — which is the strongest thing available
without making `just check` open pull requests.

It would have caught every one of the drift items found by hand in August 2026:
PR_CONFIRM missing in two repos, open-pr not pushing in one, and merge-pr having no CI gate
at all in two.

WHY THESE RECIPES ARE NOT SHARED VERBATIM LIKE THE INSTALL FAMILY
-----------------------------------------------------------------
They legitimately differ: `cargo clippy` is bare in rusticprofile, `--workspace` in retch and
`--all-targets` in etr; the NOTES header is `## Current State (vX)` in two and
`## Current state: vX` in the third; retch's checklist has wiki and tldr items, etr's has
PROTOCOL.md, rusticprofile's has neither. Forcing one body would mean changing what each gate
*does*, which is a behaviour change per repo rather than a copy. So what is standardised is
their **behaviour**, and this file is what stops that behaviour drifting apart again.
