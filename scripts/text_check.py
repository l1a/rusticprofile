"""Refuse control characters and carriage returns in tracked text files.

Two defect classes, both of which this repository has actually shipped, and both of which
are invisible to review because the damage is a byte rather than a word.

1. A LONE CONTROL BYTE, from a backslash collapsing in transport. `~/AGENTS.md` sec.14
   records the mechanism: a double backslash in a command handed to an agent's shell
   arrives as a single one BEFORE the shell sees it, so `usr\\bin` in the intended text
   becomes `usr` + 0x08. A quoted heredoc does not prevent it. `templates/justfile-common.just`
   carried exactly that for months -- line 22 read `usr` + 0x08 + `in` -- in a file whose
   whole purpose is to be vendored byte-identically into the sibling repositories.

   The danger is not cosmetic. Whatever consumes the text next reads the surviving single
   backslash as an escape, so the same collapse has previously written a non-comment line
   into a nushell config and aborted the rest of the file. `\\a` becomes 0x07, `\\n` becomes
   a real newline that silently splits a paragraph, and the file still renders -- wrongly.

2. A CARRIAGE RETURN. `.gitattributes` pins `* text=auto eol=lf` because this tree is
   Syncthing-shared across Linux, macOS and Windows, and the file says so in as many words.
   A CRLF worktree copy is therefore always drift, and git NORMALISES IT OUT OF ITS OWN VIEW
   rather than reporting it. Measured on git 2.55.0 in this tree, planting CRLF in one
   tracked file:

       git status --short   ->  ` M scripts/copr_check.py`
       git diff             ->  NOTHING. No hunk, no name, just a stderr warning.
       git add <file>       ->  git status is now CLEAN, and 365 CRs are still on disk.

   So the drift is visible exactly once, as an ` M` with no diff behind it -- which reads as
   noise -- and the first `git add` that touches the file erases the only signal while
   leaving every byte in place. Thereafter chezmoi, python and every shell see the CRs and
   git sees nothing. This repository has met it from the other side: `Set-Content` rewrote
   `Cargo.toml` CRLF while the index stayed LF (`WIP.md`, 2026-08-12), and
   `~/.claude/settings.json` sits in the same state today.

   The unambiguous oracle is `git ls-files --eol`, which reports `i/lf w/crlf` throughout.

WHY THIS IS A CHECK AND NOT A CONVENTION: every instance above was found by reading bytes,
never by reading the file. A guard is the only thing that looks. It is the same argument
`0.0.3` made for duplicating the golden gate into CI -- enforcement that binds whatever
tool is driving.

DO NOT BUILD THIS OUT OF `grep`. `grep -c $'\\r'` from an agent shell is the subject of
`~/AGENTS.md` sec.17 -- the pattern collapses to empty, `grep` matches every line, and the
answer that comes back is the file's LINE COUNT wearing a carriage-return costume. It is
wrong in both directions, and the tell is that it equals `wc -l`. Count bytes in a language
that has them.
